# selection-Sort
just a simple selection sort in python 
here how it works :
first it consider the first elemnet as min, then it go over the array to see if it is really the min or not. if it was min then the program go to next element, otherwise, it change the position of the actuall minimum and the chosen element and then go to next element and repeat this steps.
